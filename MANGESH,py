Edit
# Initialize an empty dictionary to store recharge records

# Function to add a recharge record
def add_recharge(mobile_number, amount, date):
    recharge_ledger.setdefault(mobile_number, []).append((amount, date))
    print(f"Recharge of {amount} on {date} added for {mobile_number}")

# Function to view recharge history for a mobile number
def view_recharge_history(mobile_number):
    if mobile_number in recharge_ledger:
        print(f"Recharge history for {mobile_number}:")
        for amount, date in recharge_ledger[mobile_number]:
            print(f"Amount: {amount}, Date: {date}")
    else:
        print(f"No recharge records found for {mobile_number}")

# Example usage
add_recharge("1234567890", 100, "2023-11-15")
add_recharge("9876543210", 200, "2023-11-16")
view_recharge_history("1234567890")
Explanation of changes:
setdefault(): Used setdefault() to simplify the logic of checking whether the mobile number already exists in the dictionary. If it doesn't exist, it initializes an empty list.

Code structure: Kept the code concise but clear, reducing unnecessary checks. The logic remains the same, only improved for efficiency and readability.

This should work in the same way as the original code but is now slightly more streamlined.
